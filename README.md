App idea: An app that helps users track which 14ers in Colorado they have hiked and rewards them for completing them. Gives users information about each hike inlcuding where the trailhead is located, the distance in miles and the elevation gain of the hike. Once the user makes it to the end of the hike, gps confirms their location and marks it as a completed hike.

Features: 
-   Lists all 14ers in Colorado and provides information about each summit hike.
-   Users can see which 14ers they have completed and which they have not.
-   Once the user reaches the summit of a 14er that they have not yet completed, gps confirms their location, rewards them and moves the 14er over to the completed list.
